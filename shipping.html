        <h2><b>What are the delivery charges?</b></h2>
        <p>Delivery charge varies with each Seller.</p>
        <p>Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases, charging a nominal delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs. Please check your order summary to understand the delivery charges for individual products.</p>
        <p>For Products listed as Buy Cycle Plus, a Rs 40 charge for delivery per item may be applied if the order value is less than Rs 500. While, orders of Rs 500 or above are delivered free.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery timeline of X-Y business days?</h2>
        <p>It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a holiday between the day your placed your order and the date of delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product page. In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the delivery dates.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is the estimated delivery time?</h2>
        <p>Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product page. Business days exclude public holidays and Sundays.</p>
